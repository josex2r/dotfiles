# Virtual Machine type (qemu, vz)
# NOTE: this is macOS 13 only. For Linux and macOS <13.0, qemu is always used.
#
# vz is macOS virtualization framework and requires macOS 13
#
# Default: qemu
vmType: vz

# Utilise rosetta for amd64 emulation (requires m1 mac and vmType `vz`)
# Default: false

# Volume mount driver for the virtual machine (virtiofs, 9p, sshfs).
#
# virtiofs is limited to macOS and vmType `vz`. It is the fastest of the options.
#
# 9p is the recommended and the most stable option for vmType `qemu`.
#
# sshfs is faster than 9p but the least reliable of the options (when there are lots
# of concurrent reads or writes).
#
# Default: virtiofs (for vz), sshfs (for qemu)
mountType: virtiofs
